CommonGameKit
=============

CommonGameKit is a collection of utilities to aid in the creation of games. While this is mostly for my own personal use, some of the things it provides are:

* Entity Component System (ECS)
	* Animation system
	* Input abstraction system
	* Rendering system
* Scripting language
* GUI
* Rendering abstraction interface (GFX)
	* OpenGL support
* Asset manager
* Text rendering/manipulation
